Extended Introduction of nDEX Network and Few Lines for Community

By Tanvir Rahaman 

The blockchain technology continues on its run of universal wide adoption. Many projects continue to surface on the platform with variety of use cases, from technology, freelance market places, real estate, to payment gateways. The use cases offer by most of these projects however do not have much significant impact on the end users of the technology, especially fun — wise.



nDEX Network is a blockchain development start up that that seeks to provide for the entire blockchain community, robust exchange platforms both centralized and decentralized to give the community a mixed sensation of both centralized and decentralized trading experience while at the same time providing a fun-enabled platform where users get to showcase their gaming skills and catch immense fun. The platform operates on a triangular platform; first is nDEX Market, Blockroll and nExbit.


nDEX Market is a decentralized Ethereum tokens exchange developed to offer users security, speed and flexibility of decentralized trading platform. By design, nDEX Market is similar and operates like the conventional ***deltas, but comes with a more speed of transaction, security and a friendly user interface (UI). (https://ndex.market)




BlockRoll is an Ethereum smart contract based dice game platform (https://blockroll.fun). The platform is set to offer nDEX community a decentralized dice gaming experience, with the web and app (google play) version of the platform nearing completion (75% completed) and expected to launch by the end of October, the entire community are on a fun-filled journey that would revolutionize peer — to — peer dice gaming.



nEXBit is a centralized full scale crypto currency exchange which will run alongside nDEX Market the sister exchange on the nDEX network. The exchange which is still under development will have its beta released by November and official launch by December.



Aside the unmatched trading and gaming experience offered by the nDEX platform, holders of NDX are rewarded for holding the token as 30% of all profits made from each platform goes to the reward pool and shared among holders. More of the reason why it is a wise decision to be part of this project and invest in the ongoing token sale.
